# Partial Payment Feature

## Overview

Businesses can now pay in installments for event registration. This feature allows registrants to make a partial payment upfront and complete the balance later.

## Features

### 1. **Frontend (Registration Form)**

- **Payment Type Selection**: Radio buttons to choose between "Full Payment" or "Partial Payment"
- **Partial Amount Input**: When partial payment is selected, users can enter the amount they want to pay now
- **Real-time Balance Calculation**: Shows remaining balance as user enters partial amount
- **Validation**: Ensures partial amount doesn't exceed total event price

### 2. **Backend (Database Model)**

Updated `Registration` model with new fields:

- `totalAmount`: Total event registration cost (from event.price)
- `amountPaid`: Cumulative amount paid (supports multiple payments)
- `remainingBalance`: Outstanding amount to be paid
- `paymentType`: Either "full" or "partial"

### 3. **Payment Processing**

- **Payment Initialization**: Accepts payment type and processes the specified amount
- **Payment Verification**:
  - Calculates cumulative payments
  - Updates remaining balance
  - Marks status as "paid" only when balance is zero
  - Keeps status as "pending" if balance remains

### 4. **Email Notifications**

Enhanced payment confirmation emails include:

- **For Full Payments**: Standard confirmation with total amount
- **For Partial Payments**:
  - Shows total amount
  - Shows amount paid
  - Highlights remaining balance with warning banner
  - Includes instructions to contact for balance payment

### 5. **Ticket Details**

Ticket attachments (PDF and TXT) now show:

- Total Amount
- Amount Paid
- Remaining Balance (if applicable)
- Partial payment indicator

## How It Works

### User Flow

1. User fills registration form
2. Proceeds to payment page
3. Selects payment type:
   - **Full Payment**: Pays complete event price
   - **Partial Payment**: Enters custom amount (e.g., 50% upfront)
4. Completes payment via Paystack
5. Receives confirmation email with:
   - Payment receipt
   - Ticket (with partial payment notice if applicable)
   - Balance reminder (if applicable)

### Example Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Full Payment (KES 40,000)

```

```
Payment Type: Partial
Total Amount: KES 40,000
Amount Paid: KES 20,000
Remaining Balance: KES 20,000
Status: PENDING ‚è≥
```

#### Scenario 3: Second Partial Payment (KES 15,000 more)

```
Payment Type: Partial
Total Amount: KES 40,000
Amount Paid: KES 35,000 (cumulative)
Remaining Balance: KES 5,000
Status: PENDING ‚è≥
```

#### Scenario 4: Final Payment (KES 5,000 balance)

```
Payment Type: Partial
Total Amount: KES 40,000
Amount Paid: KES 40,000 (cumulative)
Remaining Balance: KES 0

```

## Database Schema Changes

```javascript
{
  totalAmount: Number,      // NEW: Total registration cost

  paymentType: String,      // NEW: "full" | "partial"
  paymentStatus: String,    // EXISTING: "pending" | "paid" | "failed" | "refunded"

```
